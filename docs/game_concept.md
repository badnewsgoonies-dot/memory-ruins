# Game Concept

Genre: Puzzle-Adventure (Narrative-driven, single-player)

Logline / Plot premise:
An exoplanetary researcher awakens in a ruined orbital research facility where time-scrambled anomalies have fractured memory and environment. To survive and piece together what happened, the player must solve environmental and temporal puzzles, recover fragments of the protagonist's journals, and choose which memories to restore — each choice reshaping later puzzles and narrative beats.

Main Character:
- Name: Dr. Mara Ives (suggested working name)
- Role: Former lead researcher on the orbital project; pragmatic, curious, ethically driven
- Arc: Begins fragmented and investigative; choices about restoring memories reveal different moral perspectives and change the facility's state.

Core Gameplay Loop (designed for 1+ hour of gameplay):
1. Explore a small interconnected facility area to locate "anomaly nodes" and journal fragments.
2. Analyze clues and set up a limited time-manipulation action (e.g., rewind/fast-forward a local object or room state) to solve a spatial or sequence-based puzzle.
3. Restore a memory fragment or adjust an anomaly parameter; observe changes to environment and narrative.
4. Use newly opened paths or altered states to reach the next anomaly node and repeat.

Key Systems and Constraints (keeps scope manageable):
- Spatial puzzles with local time-manipulation mechanic (affects objects/doors within a room) rather than full-world rewinds to limit complexity.
- Inventory-lite: only a small set of tools (scanner, recorder, time-anchor device) to avoid heavy UI/asset requirements.
- Narrative fragments serve as both worldbuilding and puzzle hints; branching is limited to 3-4 meaningful states to keep content production feasible.

Feasibility & Deliverables for a 1+ Hour Experience:
- Level design: 4-6 rooms/areas with 2-3 puzzles each, increasing in complexity and using permutations of the time mechanic.
- Art/audio scope: stylized, modular assets for environment + 10-15 short voice-over or text-fragment entries.
- Prototype goal: single coherent playthrough of 45-90 minutes, with clear puzzle rules and a final resolution determined by recovered memory state.

How this meets product requirements:
- Clear single-player focus with a bounded play session (1+ hour) and minimal systems to implement.
- No reliance on large multiplayer or online services; all mechanics are local to the facility.
- Branching is constrained to avoid combinatorial explosion while still offering replay value.

Next steps (suggested): create a one-page level flow for the first facility area, define 6-8 puzzle interactions, and draft the first 5 memory fragments.

# Vision-Derived Design Brief

## Reference Games Analyzed
- Hollow Knight (Team Cherry) - 2D action-platformer Metroidvania
- Hades (Supergiant Games) - Isometric action roguelike

## Key Mechanics Observed
- 2D Platforming & Exploration: The player character moves horizontally, jumps between platforms, and navigates vertically through varied cavernous and structured environments.
- 2D Platforming: Player character moves horizontally and vertically, jumping across varied terrain and traversing gaps.
- 2D Platforming: The player character navigates platforms, jumps, and moves horizontally across levels. Vertical traversal is emphasized, indicated by the 'DESCEND' text overlay and multi-tiered environments.
- 2D platforming with vertical and horizontal traversal.
- A 'Charm' system for character customization, allowing players to equip abilities that alter or enhance existing mechanics (e.g., 'Sharp Shadow' for a damaging dash, 'Lifeblood Heart' for temporary health upon resting).
- A 'Notch' resource system for equipping Charms, where each Charm has a 'Cost' in notches.
- A Soul/Magic meter, likely for casting spells or special abilities.
- A health system represented by mask-like icons, diminishing upon damage.
- Ability Acquisition: The player gains new powers, as indicated by the 'MASTER NEW POWERS' prompt, which includes a horizontal 'dash' ability demonstrated by the glowing trail.
- Active combat system featuring melee attacks (sword) and a distinct enemy with ranged abilities (fiery projectiles).
- Boon/upgrade system, where the player selects from a choice of new abilities or enhancements (e.g., 'Lightning Strike,' 'Thunder Flourish') that modify existing moves with elemental damage and effects. These boons are often presented by Olympian-themed characters.
- Boss Encounter: A multi-headed creature serves as a central antagonist, suggesting a significant boss fight mechanic with potentially multiple targets or phases based on its numerous heads and changing visual state.
- Boss battle mechanics, including multiple phases (summoning additional heads) and distinct attack patterns.
- Boss battles with distinct phases and attack patterns (e.g., Mantis Lords, needle-wielding character, large armored enemies).
- Boss or mini-boss encounter due to the unique design and size of the enemy.

## UI/UX Patterns
- A circular meter, located next to the health icons, represents a resource (likely 'Soul' or 'Energy') used for special abilities. It is shown filling and depleting.
- A dedicated 'Boons of [Deity]' menu is used for selecting character upgrades, displaying options with descriptive text, damage values, and rarity indicators ('Rare').
- A dedicated 'Charms' menu allows players to view and equip charms from their 'Collection' into 'Equipped' slots. This menu clearly shows a 'Notches' gauge, and details for selected charms including 'Cost', a description, and an 'Equip' prompt (e.g., 'Equip Z').
- A final title card explicitly displaying the game's name 'HADES'.
- A numerical counter next to the health bar (e.g., '1 / 1', '3 / 3'), likely for a limited-use item or ability.
- A numerical counter, accompanied by a currency-like icon (resembling a geode), tracks a resource called 'geo' in the top-left, positioned below the health and soul meter.
- A prominent red enemy health bar at the top center, labeled 'LERNAEAN BONE HYDRA'.
- A small, shadowy companion or status icon appears next to the health bar in some combat scenes.
- A vertical column on the left side of the screen displaying five ability/boon icons with level indicators (e.g., Lvl. 2, Lvl. 4) and one showing a '+6' modifier.
- Ability icons arranged vertically on the left side of the screen, likely representing equipped attacks, special moves, and dashes.
- Boss title cards, such as 'MANTIS LORDS', appear on screen to introduce significant encounters.
- Character level indicator ('Lv.2') on the left UI panel.
- Charm icons are distinct and visually represent their effects.
- Cinematic full-screen text overlays reading 'SEE YOU', 'IN', and 'HELL' transition between segments.
- Combat feedback text, such as 'DEFLECTED!'.

## Design Recommendations
1. **Health System**: Mask-based HP (Hollow Knight style) - clear visual feedback
2. **Combat**: Melee-focused with dash/dodge mechanics
3. **Progression**: Ability unlocks + currency for upgrades
4. **Art Style**: High-contrast 2D with readable silhouettes
5. **Audio**: Ambient music with combat stingers

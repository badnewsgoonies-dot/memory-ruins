# Celeste GDC Talk: Design Insights for Memory Ruins

## 1. Level Design Principles — Teaching Through Play

**"Fractal Stories"**: Every level tells a micro-story (e.g., "climb shaky block, jump before spikes"). Design around *one clear challenge* per room.

**Implicit Teaching Hierarchy**:
1. **Prime** — Introduce mechanics in safe/trivial contexts first
2. **Kill to teach** — Death forces players to confront what happened (low-cost respawns make this viable)
3. **Branch for strugglers** — Add optional side paths with explicit tutorials; skilled players never see them

**Multiple Approaches**: Let players solve puzzles *their way*. Overlap mechanics (dash/climb/jump) so solutions vary by player skill. Never design rigid "input sequences."

> *"Skips are fair game for experts—just ensure no beginner mistakes them for the intended path."*

## 2. Difficulty Progression — Stakes & Pacing

**Story-Driven Ramp**: Each "area" (world) has its own arc—rising action, climax, cooldown. Match player emotional state to character's journey.

**Length = Stakes**: Longer rooms amplify stress. Use sparingly at narrative peaks. Most rooms stay single-screen to minimize repetition punishment.

**Avoid Flat Arcs**: A pure chase sequence feels flat—add exploration before, cooldown after. Frame intense moments with contrast.

## 3. Room Design — Safety as Pacing

**Safety Spectrum**:
| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Solid ground | Full rest, refills resources |
| Wall clings | Temporary, drains stamina |
| Crumbling blocks | Brief pause, forces movement |

**Pacing Formula**: 
- Hard moves + safe rests = slow/tense  
- Easy moves + no safety = fluid/frantic

Keep rooms short. End at any full-safety point—otherwise you're intentionally raising stakes.

## 4. Player Communication — No Text Tutorials

**Environmental Teaching**:
- Show mechanic → let player fail → they internalize the rule
- Use "locked" scenarios where only one action works (forced lightbulb moments)
- Place optional teaching branches off-path for struggling players

**"Obviously Impossible" Rule**: If a skip looks *almost* possible, players tunnel-vision and frustrate. Block bad paths clearly (add spikes, widen gaps).

## 5. Accessibility & Retention

**Low Death Cost**: Instant respawn at room start. No checkpoints needed when rooms are small.

**Collectibles as Progress**: Strawberries persist even if you die after grabbing them—consolation prize during grindy sections.

**Avoid Cycles**: Never make players wait at room starts. Front-load discoverable shortcuts so repetition becomes optimization.

**Multiple Approaches for Replay**: Obvious path for first attempt → faster path emerges after 50 tries.

## Key Takeaways for Memory Ruins

1. **One story per room** — Define the challenge, remove friction outside it
2. **Teach by death** — Cheap respawns let failure be the teacher
3. **Safety controls pacing** — Alternate rest/tension deliberately  
4. **Hide tutorials in branches** — Don't patronize skilled players
5. **Short rooms, low stakes** — Save long gauntlets for climactic moments
6. **Enable skips for experts** — Reward mastery without confusing beginners

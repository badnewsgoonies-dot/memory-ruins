# Metroidvania Design Principles for Memory Ruins
*Extracted from GMTK's Super Metroid Analysis*

## 1. Lock & Key Progression

- **Visual Locks**: Use distinct colored doors/obstacles that clearly communicate "you need X ability"
- **Block Icons**: Show the required powerup icon on locked barriers (Super Metroid's approach)
- **Cascade Design**: Each new ability unlocks multiple previously-seen obstacles
- **Avoid Random Bombing**: Make secrets well-telegraphed with visual hints, not pixel-hunting

## 2. World Interconnection

- **Hub-and-Spoke**: Elevators branch into distinct zones—easy mental mapping
- **One-Way Loops**: Rooms that bend back on themselves, returning players to hubs after exploration
- **Unique Room Identity**: Every room should look distinct for landmark recognition
- **Visual Landmarks**: Imposing/spooky faces, distinct architecture = memorable waypoints

## 3. Backtracking Design

- **Power-Up Tutorials**: Getting a new ability? Force player to use it immediately to escape
- **Bounce Between Zones**: After each upgrade, next use may be in a *previous* area—training cross-map thinking
- **Organic Discovery**: Let players stumble upon the path forward rather than directing them
- **Victory Lap Moments**: Mid-game exploration breaks where players revisit with new powers

## 4. Exploration Flow

**Two-Act Structure (Brilliant Pattern):**
1. **Act 1 - Tight Grip**: One-way paths, small explorable chunks, very limited ability uses
2. **Act 2 - Release**: World opens up after tutorial phase; player must find their own way

**Guiding Without Linearity:**
- Close off areas with one-way paths early (prevents overwhelm)
- Map rooms are almost as valuable as powerups
- Show rooms you can't reach yet (spooky face behind high ledge)
- Soft-guide: the *next room* after getting an item hints where to use it

## Key Takeaways for Memory Ruins

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Constrained Start** | Begin with few paths; open world gradually |
| **Mental Notes** | Obstacles should be memorable, not hidden |
| **Loop Design** | New areas should circle back to known zones |
| **Powerup = Key** | Every ability should unlock 5-7 visible barriers |
| **No Dead Ends** | If stuck, players should recognize missed hints |

> *"The goal of a Metroidvania designer is to find a balance between letting the player explore on their own but also not letting them get too lost and frustrated."*
